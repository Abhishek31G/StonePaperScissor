# StonePaperScissor
In this project, we will create a Stone-Paper-Scissor game in Python using OOPS concept(Classes and Objects) and random module.

Project Description Here's how our project works:

This game will be played between the computer and the user.
The computer will randomly pick either rock, paper or scissors.
The user will not know the computer's pick.
The user will be asked to choose either rock, paper or scissors.
We will compare the computer's pick and the user's pick and decide whether the user won or lost or drew.
At last, we will ask user whether he wants to continue playing this game or not?
